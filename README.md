# gsuba-fusion
Greenville Associates Fusion Shell

This shell provides a Open Platform Targeted Windowing System(On Windows/Linux/Unix) to provide javascript, HML5, PHP, Custom Microsoft(.ASPX), and Adobe Cold Fusion binaries to work in an integrated web framework. The Shell also hides the complexity of the software solution from the search bar, making it much friendlier to computer security architects. The shell works with IIS, Apache, and NGINX web servers without modification and links to any database platform supported by your web server. The First release
is targeted for Mysql or Postgres Users using PHP or cPanel(Installatron or Softalicuous Users) but can be used as a standalone web page environment without them.

In General the Gsuba-fusion shell provides a Commerical Desktop Experience to web applications with support for 1080p with a minor modification. The GSuba Shell also installs PHP Driven Web solutions from Joomla, Drupal, and Worpdress out of the box allowing non-developers the ability to complete their marketing tasks on a very sophisticated platform.

We can rebuild corporate Lanscapes at Levels as low as three deep using Image Maps, combined with a Joomla datastore. The default install includes a Header and Footer File which can be customized to meet your business needs. (header.html), and (footer.html).

In the first release we delivered a fixed web platform of 1200px x Unlimited, while the system fixes the bottom bar to a corporate logo offering a much more sophisticated marketing delivery. The 2nd Release as included herein has a bootstrap program in index.html which determines the screen resolution and then forwards the code to one or more framing standards. The frame itself has been extensively tested and allows a single responsive template for web delivery. An Optional overlay mobile solution can be added with a different code base to add interest.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING WORDPRESS LINKS

Wordpress in Version 2 is included in the /w directory and includes the Postgres drivers preconfigured. However Postgres needs to be installed
manually, and appropriate database permisions for the 2Dot release need to be done by a qualified administrator. G/a is not bundling Postgres
in this solution specifically as we do not have as yet an agreement to do so with them.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING JOOMLA LINKS

Joomla supports Postgres PHP installations natively and the Joomal installation directory is included in the ./h directory. Its fully functional,
but like Wordpress, the Postgres DBMS needs to be installed and your users created. We have offered instructions of how to install Postgres for MACOS, Linux,
and Windows including the PGADMIN administration tool.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING FUSIONSHELL TO CPANEL(V1/V2/V3) - Shared cPAnel Users.

In Cpanel, Git needs to be used to install the base package, but cpanel doesnt include Mysql as a base. Cpanel however does have different
versions which run on Posgtres and can be downloaded from them. This allows the V2 shell to be used effectively, however we recommend if you
have a cPanel server with Installatron(Web.com, others) or Softalicious(SiteGround, etc) then you should install the V1 shell, and then install
wordpress and joomla to the target directories.

On Cpanel put the V1 Shell in the root hosting account, and use Softalicious, or Installatron to install applications for the shell. Then just change the links in the header.html file to the location of your code. And Wala you are done.

EXAMPLES CAN BE FOUND ON CAPITOLTECHNOLOGY.US, AND GREENVILLEASSOCIATES.US

If you do this will allow you to maintain consistency with future releases. We have a very complicated example we are building under capitoltechnology.us which uses the same technology fully blown out if you want to see a live example.

It took a few years to make it look nice... so it looks simple but to get cross-browser support looking good is quite difficult in fact.

RELEASE 2 CHANGES 

RELEASE2 is HERE! The G/a shell now dynamically adjusts the framesize we have set to 1300px's in the Index.html. Changing that feed to 1040px, or 1200px is easy to do. PLease note almost all new phones, and new PC's will support 1400x1200 resolutions or higher. Older PC's typically dont do too well with HTML in general so we have decided to make a clean break.

RELEASE3 will include an integreate Web Mobility client for Android, and for IoS which should be Q1, 2020, and offer proprietary MS-SQL technologies as well as the FusionOpen, and FusionShell Products which are opensource bases.
